# CS-305-Software-Security

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  Artemis Financial was a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers. They wanted to modernize their operations and maintain       high security.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
  I think I did very well with documenting these vulnerabilities and correctly identifying how to resolve them, while suppressing false positives. Security is vital to     maintain a company's wellbeing due to financial reasons, reputation, etc.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
  Learning to code the usage of security systems and checkSums and how to generate and apply certificates was the most helpful.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
  I increased layers of security by making it use a secure https domain, adding a certificate, updating dependencies, etc.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  By using the checkSum to verify it was working properly and by performing dependency checks and suppressing false positives.
  
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  The checkSum could be useful in addition to the dependency checks. I think general syntax that always applies to good code is a strong practice.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
  I think showing a general awareness of how to code securely and verify things like dependencies is a solid foundation.
